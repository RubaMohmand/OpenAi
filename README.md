This project is a simple AI-powered Q&A web application that allows users to input questions and receive answers using OpenAI's API. The solution includes:

Front-End: A clean, responsive web page with an input form for submitting questions.
Back-End: A Python-based server (Flask) to handle user queries, process them via OpenAI's API, and return responses.
It is designed for ease of use, scalability, and future reusability, with detailed documentation for setup and maintenance.


Note: Add your OpenAi Api key in .env file.
